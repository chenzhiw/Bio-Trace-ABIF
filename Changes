Revision history for Bio-Trace-ABIF

0.01    2006-10-26/17:30
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
        
0.02    2006-11-15/22:30
        Added method to compute CRL (Contiguous Read Length).
        A few bugs fixed in the documentation.

1.00    2007-02-16/12:30
        - Added methods to read all the ab1 file tags specified by the ABIF
          format, including fsa tags.
        - Added method write_tag() to overwrite existing data.
        - Methods returning a scalar now return 'undef' in case of error
          (e.g., tags not found).
        - Signed shorts and longs are correctly unpacked.
        - Methods sorted alphabetically.
        - Fixed a version mismatch.
        - contiguous_read_length() has now mandatory arguments. Trimming the
          ends is now optional. The method returns (-1, -1) when no CRL exists.
        - Fized a bug in sample_score() occasionally causing division by zero.
          Also, sample_score() in some cases returned negative values: this has
          been fixed, too.
        - Changed the semantics of clear_range_start() and clear_range_stop():
          both methods return -1 if no clear range exists.
        - Fixed bugs in clear_range_start() and clear_range_stop() that would
          cause an error in some (very unfortunate) cases.
        - Added clear_range() method, which returns an interval (start, stop).
        - Much faster conversion from binary to floats.
        - Fixed a bug in analysis_protocol_xml().

1.01    2007-04-03/18:05
        - Fixed bug causing wrong return values from analyzed_data_for_channel()
          and raw_data_for_channel() methods.

1.02   2008-12-17/18:42
        - Fixed a bug in order_base(), raw_trace() and trace() methods.
          WARNING!
          Note that the semantics of order_base() has changed! Now, the method
          returns the channel number, not the array index (to avoid off-by-one
          errors when using this method with other methods requiring a channel
          as a parameter).
        - Fixed a bug in offscale_peaks().
        - Added a channel() method, returning the channel number corresponding
          to a given base.
        - Slightly improved documentation.
