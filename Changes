        - contiguous_read_length() has now mandatory arguments. Trimming the
          ends is now optional.
        - Added methods to read all the ab1 file tags specified by the ABIF
          format, including fsa tags.
        - Added method write_tag() to overwrite existing data.
        - Methods returning a scalar now return 'undef' in case of error
          (e.g., tags not found).
        - Signed shorts and longs are correctly unpacked.
        - Methods sorted alphabetically.
        - Fixed a version mismatch.
        - Fized a bug in sample_score() occasionally causing division by zero.
          Also, sample_score() in some cases returned negative values: this has
          been fixed, too.
        - Changed the semantics of clear_range_start() and clear_range_stop():
          both methods return -1 if no clear range exists.
        - Fixed bugs in clear_range_start() and clear_range_stop() that would
          cause an error in some (very unfortunate) cases.
        - Added clear_range() method, which returns an interval (start, stop).
        - Much faster conversion from binary to floats.
        - Fixed a bug in analysis_protocol_xml()
